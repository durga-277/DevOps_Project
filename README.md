# DevOps Project Repository

Welcome to the DevOps Project repository! This project encompasses the complete DevOps lifecycle, from initial development to deployment and monitoring.

## About
This project is designed to demonstrate a comprehensive DevOps pipeline, integrating various tools and technologies to automate and streamline the software development process.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **Jenkins**: Automation server for continuous integration and continuous delivery.
- **SonarQube**: Code quality and security analysis tool to ensure clean, maintainable code.
- **Docker**: Containerization platform for building, shipping, and running applications.
- **Kubernetes**: Container orchestration tool for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
- **Git**: Version control system for tracking changes in codebase.

## Stages
The project is divided into the following stages:

### 1. Initial Stage
This stage involves setting up the development environment, initializing the project structure, and establishing version control.

### 2. Building Stage
In this stage, the project is built, compiled, and tested automatically upon code changes. Continuous Integration (CI) with Jenkins ensures code integrity and early issue detection.

### 3. Deployment Stage
The deployment stage focuses on deploying the application to staging or production environments automatically. Kubernetes orchestrates container deployment and scaling, while Docker ensures consistent environments across different stages.

### Note
this is NodeJs.applications and it a clone of netflix we need to set an api key for this to creating Docker image to get API Key form "TMDB" 

Feel free to explore the code, configurations, and pipelines to understand the DevOps practices implemented in this project. Contributions and feedback are always welcome!
